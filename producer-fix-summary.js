/**
 * PRODUCER NOT FOUND ERROR - COMPREHENSIVE FIX
 * 
 * PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
 * The "Producer not found" error was caused by aggressive cleanup when users
 * disconnected temporarily. The system was immediately deleting producers
 * when users lost connection, but other users were still trying to consume
 * those producers, leading to "Producer not found" errors.
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE:
 * 1. User A creates a producer (video/audio stream)
 * 2. User B tries to consume it
 * 3. User A disconnects (even briefly - network issue, page refresh, etc.)
 * 4. removeParticipant() immediately deletes User A's producers
 * 5. User B's consume request fails with "Producer not found"
 * 
 * FIX IMPLEMENTED:
 * 1. GRACEFUL PRODUCER CLEANUP: Producers now have a 30-second grace period
 * 2. CONSUMER-ONLY CLEANUP: Temporary disconnects only clean up consumers
 * 3. EXPLICIT LEAVE HANDLING: Full cleanup only on explicit class leave
 * 4. PRODUCER STATE VALIDATION: Check if producers are closed before consuming
 * 5. COMPREHENSIVE DEBUGGING: Added extensive logging to track lifecycle
