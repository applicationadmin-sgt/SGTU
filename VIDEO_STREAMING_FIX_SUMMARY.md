# Video Streaming Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Students Unable to See Their Own Video
**Problem**: Students couldn't see their own video feed
**Cause**: Local video was being initialized but the video element wasn't properly connected
**Fix**: The local video initialization was already correct, but we ensured proper video element reference and autoplay

### 2. Teacher Video Not Streaming to Students
**Problem**: Students couldn't receive teacher's video stream
**Cause**: Multiple issues:
- WebRTC manager was never connected to the mediasoup server
- Remote stream callbacks (`onRemoteStream`, `onUserJoined`, `onUserLeft`) were never set up
- Participant video elements were using placeholders instead of actual video streams

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Added WebRTC Connection**: Connected the WebRTC manager to the mediasoup server after initialization
2. **Setup Remote Stream Callbacks**: Added callbacks to receive and display remote video streams from teachers/participants
3. **Updated Video Elements**: Modified all participant video displays to show actual video streams when available

### 3. MUI Tooltip Warnings
**Problem**: Console errors about disabled buttons in Tooltips
```
MUI: You are providing a disabled `button` child to the Tooltip component.
A disabled element does not fire events.
```
**Cause**: Screen share button was accessible to students who don't have permission
**Fix**: Removed screen share button visibility for students entirely using role-based conditional rendering

### 4. Screen Share Permission Errors
**Problem**: Students were seeing errors when trying to access screen share
```
Error: Screen sharing not allowed for role: student
```
**Cause**: Screen share UI controls were visible but not functional for students
**Fix**: Added role-based conditional rendering to hide screen share controls for students:
- Hidden in bottom control bar
- Hidden in content type toggle buttons
- Only visible for: teacher, admin, hod, dean roles

## Code Changes

### File: `CodeTantraLiveClass.js`

#### 1. Added WebRTC Server Connection (Line ~1011)
```javascript
// Connect to mediasoup server
try {
  console.log('🔗 Connecting WebRTC manager to mediasoup server...');
  await webrtcManager.current.connect({
    classId: classId,
    userId: currentUser?.id || currentUser?._id,
    userRole: activeRole,
    socketUrl: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000'
  });
  console.log('✅ WebRTC manager connected to mediasoup server');
} catch (webrtcError) {
  console.error('⚠️ WebRTC connection failed (non-critical):', webrtcError);
  toast.warning('Video streaming may be limited.');
}
```

#### 2. Setup Remote Stream Callbacks (Line ~1011)
```javascript
webrtcManager.current.onRemoteStream = (peerId, stream, kind) => {
  console.log('📺 Received remote stream:', { peerId, kind, hasStream: !!stream });
  
  if (stream) {
    // Update participant with stream
    setParticipants(prev => prev.map(p => {
      if (p.id === peerId) {
        return { ...p, stream, hasVideo: kind === 'video' || p.hasVideo };
      }
      return p;
    }));
  }
};
```

#### 3. Updated Participant Video Elements
Added video stream rendering in multiple locations:
- Screen share view thumbnails (Line ~1807)
- Grid view participant cards (Line ~2116)
- Pinned video thumbnails (Line ~1607)

Example:
```javascript
{participant.stream ? (
  <video
    ref={(el) => {
      if (el && participant.stream) {
        el.srcObject = participant.stream;
      }
    }}
    autoPlay
    playsInline
    style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%', objectFit: 'cover' }}
  />
) : (
  <Avatar>{participant.name[0]}</Avatar>
)}
```

#### 4. Role-Based Screen Share Control (Line ~3356)
```javascript
{/* Screen Share Control - Only for teachers/admins */}
{['teacher', 'admin', 'hod', 'dean'].includes(activeRole) && (
  <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: 0.5, ml: 1 }}>
    <Tooltip title={isScreenSharing ? 'Stop screen sharing' : 'Share screen'}>
      <IconButton onClick={toggleScreenShare}>
        {isScreenSharing ? <StopScreenShare /> : <ScreenShare />}
      </IconButton>
    </Tooltip>
  </Box>
)}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Students:
✅ Can see their own video when camera is enabled
✅ Can see teacher's video stream in real-time
✅ Can see other participants' video streams
✅ No screen share button visible (no permission errors)
✅ No MUI Tooltip warnings in console

### For Teachers:
✅ Can see their own video
✅ Can see all student videos
✅ Can share screen
✅ Screen share controls properly visible

## Testing Steps

1. **Test Student Video**:
   - Student joins class
   - Enable camera
   - Verify own video appears in local video element

2. **Test Teacher→Student Streaming**:
   - Teacher joins with camera enabled
   - Student joins
   - Verify student can see teacher's video
   - Teacher toggles camera on/off
   - Verify student sees the changes

3. **Test Screen Share Permissions**:
   - Student joins class
   - Verify no screen share button in controls
   - Verify no screen share option in content type toggles
   - No console errors about screen sharing

4. **Test Console Cleanliness**:
   - Open browser console
   - Join class
   - Verify no MUI Tooltip warnings
   - Verify no permission errors

## Technical Notes

### WebRTC Connection Flow
1. Initialize local media (camera/microphone)
2. Create WebRTC manager instance
3. Setup remote stream callbacks
4. Connect to mediasoup server
5. Create send/receive transports
6. Start producing (teachers) or consuming (students) media

### Stream State Management
- Participant streams are stored in state: `participants[].stream`
- Video elements use refs to attach streams: `el.srcObject = stream`
- Streams are automatically updated when callbacks fire

### Permission Model
- Media access: All users can request camera/microphone
- Media usage: Controlled by class settings (allowStudentMic, allowStudentCamera)
- Screen share: Only teachers/admins (enforced in UI and backend)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bandwidth Optimization**: Implement adaptive bitrate based on connection quality
2. **Stream Quality Selection**: Allow users to choose video quality
3. **Grid Layout Optimization**: Better handling of many simultaneous video streams
4. **Connection Recovery**: Auto-reconnect on network issues
5. **Audio Indicators**: Visual feedback for who is speaking
