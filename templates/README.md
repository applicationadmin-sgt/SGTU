## üí° Tips for Large Scale (20K+ Students)

1. **Test First**: Upload 10-20 records to validate format
2. **Split Files**: Keep batch sizes between 500-1000 rows
3. **Sequential Upload**: Complete sections ‚Üí courses ‚Üí teachers ‚Üí students
4. **Error Handling**: Download failed rows, fix errors, re-upload
5. **Parallel Processing**: Use multiple browser tabs for different sections
6. **Verify Data**: Cross-check counts after each batch
7. **Keep Backups**: Save original CSV files before upload

## üìû Support

For issues with bulk uploads:
1. Check validation errors in the response
2. Verify all prerequisite data exists (schools, departments, courses)
